TODO: Refactor and get in git.

TODO:Add undo.

Working on Component Menu.
Dragging needs to be different - if its content or a component.
"mode"
When menu item hovers over drop - get that to work.
And then to have it work on mouseUp as well. 


If its not on a drop when you let go of mouse..

Latest - it injects the test ndde after whichever had the rollover. (probably we can git rid of the "insert before" action!)
REMOVE the item when exiting zone.
Maake the item look temporary.
Delete items.
Drag items.



:)

Or experiment with rendering all of the drop points on all of the items, based on orientation and position. 
Could eaach item render its own droppoint?

But really I would like to have a suggested locatoin all of the time? But could do it with hiding the bars as well.
Check availability for item type?
